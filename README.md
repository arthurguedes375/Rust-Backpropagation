# About
This rust implementation of the back propagation machine learning algorithm is not perfect.
As far as I'm concerned it has no noticeable bugs, but the code is a little bit messy because I only work at this project on my free time.

# Learning resources that I used:
Besides the libraries' documentations I used the content of this [free online course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) provided by Stanford University and hosted by Coursera as a starting point.
You can read the notes that I took during this course [here](resources/Back%20propagation.md)
